                    Conceptual design was used to create key components of the application. Typically, many ideas were generated in a short amount of time as a result of brainstorming. We also used design cards to increase the breadth of our ideas. Some of the critical cards we used were particularly challenging, some even seemed irrelevant, but our goal was not to be conservative. No idea is a bad idea!

                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li><p><strong>Affinity diagramming: </strong>After studying qualitative research methods formally, I understood that affinity diagramming is in fact, a bi-product of thematic analysis and emerging theory analysis. This is a very powerful tool, and makes such a complicated data easy to deduce and extract the persona of interest. (I know, it is exciting!)</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Books for life: </strong>Many times books comes to our rescue in doing new things. "About Face" by Alan Cooper (nope, he hasn't paid me. He does not even know I exist) was very instrumental in keeping up with the methods.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Power of Persona: </strong>Don't underestimate the power of persona (do not over estimate as well!). Drafting personas was something I enjoyed dearly. This is perhaps the most valuable gift to Human-Centered Design. Yes, this method is indeed scientific (social science)</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Never lose sight of goal: </strong>It is easy to lose sight of the goal while in the heat of the design. HCDD is extremely powerful design method, only if it is used in a proper way. Negligence and misinterpretation could result in flawed design. The very reason for the design lies within the goal and the vision. We don't want a desktop, while we were asked to build a tablet, do we?</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>The Magic: </strong>"Wingardium Leviosa". While we are designing, we might end up with a concept, which might not look feasible on first thought. Our tasks are associated with our beliefs. Try imagining the task as magic, and the magic will happen. It happened here as well. The proof is, I am working on this project as a part of NSF grant full-time, which is much more exciting, than it was at the beginning.</p></li>
