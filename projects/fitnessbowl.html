                    When client talked to me about developing the website to enforce his business plan, he mentioned that he had no idea about web development, UX or any of the stuff. Since I had some experience with UX design, I suggested some quick, less-expensive but reliable methods to implement his website. His main concentration was attracting customers and of course awe them with "Wow".<br /><br />

                        <li><p><strong>Time:</strong> Even the time matters a lot. Because development period was short (6-8 months), trade-off on usability was not an option.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Benefits of design thinking:</strong> All the client stakeholders such as owner, social media marketing associates, investors and partners were involved in design thinking session. This tremendously helped me in getting aligned to their goals and visions. Further, they were very happy, that they were being involved in all the phases of design and development.<br /> "Its just like seeing your kid growing up in front of you!" - a client mentioned after the release. </p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Power of teamwork:</strong> Team work for concept design utilized many great ideas. They had some usability issues initially and I fixed all of them. In contrast to popular notion that visually rich user interfaces hamper the experience, this design proved beneficial for marketing. My client was often told that the gallery looked very delicious!</p></li>
