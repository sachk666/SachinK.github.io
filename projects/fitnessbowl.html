                    When client talked to me about developing the website to enforce his business plan, he mentioned that he had no idea about web development, UX or any of the stuff. Since I had some experience with UX design, I suggested some quick, less-expensive but reliable methods to implement his website. His main concentration was attracting customers and ofcourse awe them with "Wow".

                    Conceptual design was used to create key components of the website such as about, gallery, contacts etc to generate multiple ideas. This phase is usually done
                    using paper and pencil, we explored different possibilities for behaviour as well as some visceral concepts of the design. This was subjected to cognitive-walkthrough

                    Hi-fidelity prototype was created using Photoshop and AXURE RP. It was annotated with issues as found during the final round of user testing, which was agile in nature. Several
                    visceral and behavioural issues were fixed after subjecting to testing.

                <p>TAKEAWAY</p>
                <p>
                    Major takeaway here was, never get too attached to your design. Yes! I had created so many innovative designs, but client declined them, either because it was too flashy, or it had complex steps involved.
                    Even the time matters a lot, since this had short development period, trade-off on usability was not an option. Another lesson was, how beneficial are these design thinking sessions? I say very much!
                    We draft MVP, client was so happy that he is being involved in all the phases. <q>"Its just like seeing a child growing up infront of you"</q> - the client said.
                    <br />
                    Another takeaway was power of team work. Team work for concept design utilized so many great ideas, which ofcourse had some
                    usability issues. I fixed most of them. On contrast to popular notion that visually rich user interfaces hamper the experience,
                    this design proved beneficial for marketing and in improving customer number. My client was often told that, the gallery looks so delicious!
